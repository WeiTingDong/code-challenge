- Mini map in detail panel
- i18n: Support both English and Chinese. Chinese content is translated by GPT.

## Limitations:
1. Only support search for Singapore cities, because https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/2-hour-weather-forecast only returns Singapore cities.
2. Only search button üîç in the search panel can be clicked. Other buttons in the search panel cannot be clicked.
3. Only tested in MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and my own external screen. Adjustments may be required for other screen sizes.

Notes:
To save time, the following files are generated by GPT:
 - /src/assets/i18n/zh.json
 - /src/app/components/auto-complete/trie.ts
 - /src/app/components/loading/loading.component.scss
